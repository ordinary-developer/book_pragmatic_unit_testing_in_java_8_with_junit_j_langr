 This repository contains my files (my code snippets and my synopses about the main book's topics) 
 for the book **"Java the complete reference"** *9-th edition* by **Herbert Schildt**.
 
 [here is the link to amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Java-The-Complete-Reference-Series/dp/0071808558/ref=pd_sim_14_7?ie=UTF8&refRID=0TY2BKJXFVWF66CHHANJ) 




installation and configuration
------------------------------

 
 Simply copy (clone the repository) and see and read it.

 To work with tests:

 - put files junit-4.12.jar and hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
   in your source directory
   (of cause it is not a good desicion, but now it is convenient)

 - to compile type
   ```
   $ javac -classpath .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar *.java

   ``` 

 - to run your tests
   ```
   $ java -classpath .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar \->
          org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestClass 

   ```
